Bias Detection System in Historical Text

Overview
This project is a Humanity Language Fine Art initiative that focuses on detecting bias in historical texts. Specifically, it examines texts related to the life and history of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj to classify them as biased or non-biased. The system aims to promote a fair representation of historical events by transforming biased texts into their non-biased equivalents.

Features
Bias Detection: Identifies whether a given historical text is biased or non-biased.
Custom Dataset: Utilizes a dataset manually created from historical events in the life of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj.
Machine Learning Integration: Implements a logistic regression model for text classification.

Project Objectives
Encourage unbiased representation of historical narratives.
Facilitate deeper understanding of historical events by removing subjective biases.
Create a robust, extensible framework for bias detection in various domains of historical studies.

Technologies Used
Python: For model development and data processing.
Machine Learning: Logistic Regression for classification.
Dataset Creation: Manually curated data from the book Raja Shivachatrapati(Balbharati Book-4th Std Maharashtra), with translations from Marathi to English.

Dataset
Size: Contains both biased and non-biased examples derived from the historical accounts of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj.
Structure: Includes labeled samples with textual data classified as biased or non-biased.
